[mysqld]
# ============= Basic Settings =============
bind-address = 0.0.0.0        # Accept connections from anywhere (or restrict it)
port = 3306                   # Default MariaDB port

# ============= Authentication =============
skip-name-resolve             = 1    # Skip DNS lookups for faster auth

# ============= Performance Tuning =============
max_connections = 200         # Max simultaneous clients
wait_timeout = 28800          # How long a connection can stay idle (seconds)
interactive_timeout = 28800   # Idle timeout for interactive clients

# Buffer sizes (memory)
key_buffer_size = 64M           # Index block buffer (only MyISAM)
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 512M  # Main RAM buffer (very important for InnoDB tables)

# ============= Storage Engine Settings =============
default_storage_engine = InnoDB  # Best default (transactional, reliable)

# InnoDB specific tuning
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1  # Safer but slightly slower (set 2 for more speed, less safety)
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M         # Buffer size for log data
innodb_file_per_table = 1           # Store each InnoDB table in its own file

# ============= Logging =============
log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log  # Error log file
slow_query_log = 1                    # Enable slow query logging
slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/slow.log
long_query_time = 2                   # Log queries slower than 2 seconds

# ============= Character Set =============
character-set-server = utf8mb4    # Full Unicode support (important!)
collation-server = utf8mb4_general_ci

# ============= Security =============
# (these are basic but good practice)
local_infile = 0                  # Disable LOCAL file loading (security)
